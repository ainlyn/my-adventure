<!-- About me -->
    <div>
        I am a content creator and creative that is passionate about coding and development in addition to UI and UX design.
        My experience may be lacking but I am compassionate about what I do and I am always willing to grow and improve my
        craft.
    <br>
        I love learning new skills and I find joy in figuring out difficult tasks. I believe my main reason for enjoying coding is 
        the ability to see my impact on a project in real time. The fact that something I have adjusted, changed or improved is 
        readily available for me to see working adds to my excitement in the field.
